## 1. Learn About Integration Patterns and Designs

## 1. 1. Integration Patterns

&uarr; [Learn About Integration Patterns and Designs](#1-learn-about-integration-patterns-and-designs)

&nbsp;

**Integration Patterns**

- Identify how systems (including components and services) interact as part of an integration solution design
- Describe (or capture) a proven way to evaluate and solve integration problems without reinventing the wheel


## 1. 2. Integration Types

&uarr; [Learn About Integration Patterns and Designs](#1-learn-about-integration-patterns-and-designs)

&nbsp;

**Application Integration**
- Focuses on extending features and fucntionality across systems
- Including:
	- UI-triggered events
	- API integrations
	- Flows
	- Connectors

**Data Integration**
- Focuses on data integration between two or more systems
- Including:
	- Data Integrity
	- Data Governance
	- Data flow-design
	- Data migration

**Process Integration**
- Focuses on extending business processes and services across systems.
- Including:
	- Events that trigger activity from one system
	- Run transactions between two systems

## 1. 3. Security Considerations

&uarr; [Learn About Integration Patterns and Designs](#1-learn-about-integration-patterns-and-designs)

&nbsp;

- Security play an important role
- Every system design has security requirements
- Solutions determine the security requirements

## 1. 4. Salesforce Lightning Platform Integration Patterns

&uarr; [Learn About Integration Patterns and Designs](#1-learn-about-integration-patterns-and-designs)

&nbsp;

**Remote Process Invocation: Request and Reply**
- Salesforce invokes a process on a remote system
- Waits for a reply

**Remote Process Invocation: File and Forget**
- Salesforce invokes a process on a remote system
- Does not wait for a reply

**Batch Data Synchronization**
- When data is updated, updates are reflected in either systems
- Updates are applied in a batch manner

**Remote Call-In**
- Remote system creates, retrieves, updates or deletes data sotred in Lightning Platform

**Data Virtualization**
- Salesforce accesses external data in real time

**High-Frequency Data Replication**
- Source system asynchronously replicates data in near-real time at high scale

**Publish/Subscribe**
- Salesforce publishes an event (not specific to a consumer)
- Any number of subscribers (consumers) listen and process the events
